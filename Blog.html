                Cupcakes may not be at the height of dessert trendiness anymore (read: now you have to wait in long
                lines for other treats), but they will always be beloved. They’re nostalgic, miniature, and can be made
                to suit any tastes and styles.

            </h2>

                If anything, grease just the top of the cupcake pan before you place the liners in— this prevents
                any sticking from the cupcake surface after it’s risen over the edge of the liner.

                You can make cupcakes out of nearly any cake recipe, which means that there are an infinite amount of
                ingredients we could talk about here. Instead, it’s better to think about the result that you want.
